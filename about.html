                    <h3>Built by a Chemical Engineering Student</h3>
                    <p>ChemE Unlocked was created by a chemical engineering student at <strong>a leading university (51
                        <strong>a leading university (Botswana International University of Science and Technology)</strong>    a leading universityInternational University of Science and Technology)</strong> who understands firsthand the challenges of mastering complex engineering concepts.</p>

                <div class="founder-why">
                    <h3>Why This Platform Exists</h3>
                    <p>As a ChemE student, I've experienced the struggle of trying to understand difficult concepts with limited resources. I've seen how quality educational materials are often locked behind paywalls or unavailable in certain regions.</p>
                    <p>This platform was born from a simple belief: <strong>If I can learn it, I can explain it. And if I can explain it, we can all master it together.</strong></p>
                    <p>ChemE Unlocked is my way of giving back to the global student community - sharing knowledge as I learn, breaking down complex topics into understandable pieces, and creating resources I wish I had when I started.</p>

                <div class="founder-vision">
                    <h3>The Vision</h3>
                    <p>To build a comprehensive, free, and accessible chemical engineering knowledge hub that serves students worldwide - from Gaborone to Mumbai, from Lagos to São Paulo, from everywhere to anywhere.</p>
                    <p>This isn't just an African platform, or a platform for developing countries. This is a <strong>global platform</strong> for anyone who wants to learn chemical engineering, regardless of where they are or what resources they have access to.</p>
